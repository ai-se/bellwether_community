This lint rule discourages splitting up components because it forces you to: create a new file, copy over all the relevant imports, move over any local functions/values (or move them into yet another shared module), export the component (which makes your split off component now a public export), and re-import it into the new module.

Having multiple components per file shouldn't be much different from having multiple functions per file. And you shouldn't be forced to make a component a public export if it's really just an internal implementation detail of another component.

There's an argument to be made about _exporting_ multiple components, but mostly just in the context of React.lazy because it can only import default exports and you don't want something else in that file being statically imported (because that will prevent it from being code-split).

enabling them. I've gone through and think that we should definitely at
least enable the rules that enforce basic spec compliance (e.g. that
props don't have typos and that all of the required props are provided
for the given role). Since these deal with basic correctness, I don't
think we need to add any verbiage to the style guide for these rules.

We still have some more that we should evaluate and decide about
enabling here, but this is a good step in the right direction.

We decided that we should only require blocks for case clauses that
actually need them because it matches the as-needed spirit of section

there was an as-needed but consistent setting for the ESLint rule, we
would consider revising this a little, but this seems good enough for

We didn't have a section on switch statements yet, so I thought about
starting one. It seemed like it would best fit between section 15
(Comparison Operators & Equality) and section 16 (Blocks), but I didn't
want to mess up all of the following numberings, since people probably
have references to them. I considered adding this near the end to
minimize this effect, but it really seemed to belong near these other
things. I landed on appending it to Section 15 (Comparison Operators &
Equality) and I think it sorta fits there since switch statements are a
related concept.

we've come to favor one-var-per-variable over one-var-only declarations.
Two things improve the maintainability of this style over one var for
multiple variables:

 1. You never have a diff of a line that's removing a `;` and inserting
    a `,`.
 2. You can't accidentally declare global variables because you have a
    one-character mistake (semicolon instead of comma):

    ```javascript
    var foo = 1,
        bar = 2;
        baz = 3; // added later and (accidentally) declared globally
