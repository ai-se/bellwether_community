Currently very buggy and not ready for production. Testing has only been done with AppIntro and not AppIntro2.

Two new methods: slideSelected() and askForPermissions().

slideSelected() gets the current slide and returns it as an int.

askForPermission() takes a String array (String[]) and then goes on to request permission. See example app for how to actually request permissions for each slide. The process is tricky because the Android code doesn't have support for single permissions. That means you must pass a String[] rather than just a String if you're using one permission. The array only has one item at position 0 which would deem it worthless, however, the Android team didn't provide support for passing strings to their methods.

Bugs:
1. The request dialog pops up as the Next button is pressed rather than after. Desired result: slide talks about permission, the user presses next, and then a permission is show WITHOUT going to the next slide. After the user chooses allow or deny, he's taken to the next slide regardless of his previous answer.

2. Currently, only onNextPressed works. I tried doing an onPageScrolled but that caused a permission request to pop up for every inch (or whatever measurement scrolling is) that the page was scrolled. This obviously is not desired.

More time and testing will go into this, but I wanted to get the basic concept out there so people get a sense of progress.
